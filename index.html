            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>I’m Esteban, a Mexican engineer with a Bachelor’s in Electrical & Electronic Engineering from UNAM (9.09/10 GPA). Now, I’m pursuing a PhD in Materials Science and Engineering at UMass Amherst, working with Trisha Andrew’s WeLab to push the boundaries of wearable and stretchable tech. My journey’s taken me from fiber optic labs in Mexico to solar cells in Saudi Arabia—now I’m here to make tech that matters.</p>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Research Experience</h2>
            <p><strong>Fiber Optic Sensors Laboratory, ICAT-UNAM</strong><br>Designed a laser diode circuit and a Michelson interferometer setup to measure transparent object properties using Python. Presented at SOMI XXXVII in Colombia.<br><strong>Thesis: Imperfection Detection</strong><br>Built a low-noise sensor with ESP32 and Python to spot micrometric flaws in reflective surfaces.<br><strong>KAUST Solar Center, Ultrafast Dynamics Group</strong><br>Interned for 6 months under Frédéric Laquai and Jose Jurado. Optimized sEQE for Organic Solar Cells, fabricated P3HT-based OSCs, and designed circuits and 3D-printed parts with LabVIEW, Python, and C++.</p>

            <h2>My Mission</h2>
            <p>I’m all about optoelectronics—wearable tech, stretchable devices, and energy harvesting. At UMass Amherst, I’ll innovate with WeLab on low-power circuits, optical sensors for health (think non-invasive glucose monitoring), and self-powered wearables. My goal? Become a professor who builds tech to improve lives—one comfortable, affordable device at a time.</p>
